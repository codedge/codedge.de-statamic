Hi! I'm Holger. I code thingies for the web. I try to help people with code.  

Most of my time I am shifting between designing software, in particular writing code in PHP and Go, explaining software and IT concepts to people or strolling the web to pick up the latest ideas. I gained, and still do, a lot of knowlodge reading through [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Github](https://github.com).

## Open Source
I am an avid open source lover maintaining some Laravel PHP packages and contributing to various open source projects on Github. 
Helping others as well as learning new things (code, projects, ...), getting insights why people chose certain (coded/architectural) decisions is a great way to improve yourself.  
Happily I got the chance being one of the core contributers for [Invoice Ninja](https://www.invoiceninja.com/).
